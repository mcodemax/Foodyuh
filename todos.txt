Something wrong with kkey uuid for FoodSearch functionality.!!!!

3. Make a component after you login 
    -list all plates(you can click ithe individual plates)
    -form to make a plate (use formikl)
    

4. Make component for individual plates
    -see above
    -

5. Don't crowd the App component 

6. backend users.js route altered. might need to readd f()s; look at jobly backend if ned to readd f()s
    -for this route also make the json validation schema since isPaid was added

7. Add a loading icon or freeze while requests are going thru to backend
priorty:
    1. make foodyuh api and test it.
        -everything done except editting and deleting a user method.
    2. now: start working on actual deisnging of frontend

Maybe make foods you can select from like a card deck looking layout.

current:: 

3/4/22 AllPlatesAddError Styling won't align at the center.
        implement plate removal
        maybe relate remove foods impletementation for delete plates implementation

fix styling on signUpForm

FoodSearch.js Error handling complete

    -get a piece of paper and map out what each component calls what
    function so we can see how to call things so we onloy have to 
    call 1 Food.js component with PlateDetails and FoodSearch
    -there is a discrepany somewhere in the backend b/c FoodPlate returns a res that has Food{details>info you want}
        while FoodSearch returns food{info you want}
        conclusion: fdcAPI absolutely returns ddiff data whether you query indiv foods 
            or search for them; make a Food component for search;
                and a seperate FoodForPlate Component



/* this is a plate
      {
				"id": 3,
				"name": "Pasta3",
				"description": "for Engliand"
			}
  */

        -I'm changing my local state(changeInfoErrors) which causes the component to rerender
        -setting state is async so changeInfoErrors will become undefined when the component rerenders while the state is being set

        -Interview answer for problems: 
            A child component of my top level App component was making an API call and 
            changing the user info on the server, but my app was not reflecting these changes
            and I could not figure out why. I realized it was because the userinfo state did not change unless making
            another API call to get the updated info from the server.
            (the server response from an API call to update did not return all the data I needed)  
            So I created a state variable in my top level App component that could be changed from the child
            component updating if userinfo was changed. In a useEffect hook an API call would be made so every time that state variable changed
            userinfo would be requested with an API call again and it would be reflected to the UI on re-rendering of my top level component.

            Above isn't best practice:
            lies/mentira below:
            Best practice would be spreading the new data info the userinfo obj with the overriding the old data with updated data from the API call updating userinfo

        -**aside: state will be set to a default value put into useState hook if a component is re-rendered
        -  //del later
        useEffect(() => {
            if (signUpErrors) {
            console.log(`signUpErrors`, signUpErrors, new Date());
            } else {
            console.log(`signUpErrors`, signUpErrors, new Date());
            }
        }, [signUpErrors]);

        console.log(`component rerender`, new Date());
        //del later
        useEffect(() => {
            if(changeInfoErrors){
                console.log(`changeInfoErrors`, changeInfoErrors, new Date());
            }else{
                console.log(`changeInfoErrors`, changeInfoErrors, new Date());
            }
        }, [changeInfoErrors])
        


Component that list all plates
    Sub Component that list top 4 foods in that plate in a window images
    Be sure to change the userinfo obj when adding to plate.

-Disable navigation to signup page if already loggedin

-setTimeout ; setTimeout isn't guaranteed to call the f()s you pass into it after the interval.
    it just passes it into the event queue after the the interval

-rewatch react lectures, esp useState

-know react lifecycle

  //GET requests don't have a request body


document the nutriton id's in the code for both frontned and backend


notes: storing api key in localstorage is bad b/c atacker can run script to access it and steal your token, this is against security best practices


REFACORING api calls in PlateDetails:
        // start
        // res.foods.map((food) => {//map is async
        // const foods = await Promise.all( res.foods.map( async (food) => {
        //   const foodDetails = await FoodyuhApi.getFoodbyFdcId(food.fdcId);
        //   food.details = foodDetails;

        //   const foodsPexelImages = await FoodyuhApi.getImages(food.details.description);
        //   food.details.image = foodsPexelImages[0].src.small;

        //   //wanted to change code to something like above but each elemtn in res.foods needs to return 1 promise
        // }));
        //end

    Use above for interview: PlateDetails originally had many for loops, first awaiting api calls, pushing them into an array with Promise.all then manipulating the food res object
        and attaching details by iterating through the array returned by Promise.all, this was repeated when attaching Pexel image data to my res object which could also not be completed 
        until all those previous calls and code was run. 
        I then refactored the code to this:
        await Promise.all( res.foods.map( async (food) => {
          const foodDetails = await FoodyuhApi.getFoodbyFdcId(food.fdcId);
          food.details = foodDetails;

          const foodsPexelImages = await FoodyuhApi.getImages(food.details.description);
          food.details.image = foodsPexelImages[0].src.small;
        })); //which performed way better and eliminated iterating through many loops, and also uses a lot less space.
